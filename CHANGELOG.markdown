CHANGELOG
=========

in progress - v0.1.2
--------------------

Initial pass of improvements:

  * album pictures now share the same protection as the pages they are on
  * added a new code widget, to allow the addition of code snippets


2011/04/15 - v0.1.1
-------------------

Baseline from the original fork from @jamesu; the only changes are
to update two of the plugins (paperclip and jrails) to provide
compatability with Ruby 1.9 and Rails 3.
